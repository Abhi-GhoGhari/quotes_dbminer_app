>With an array of features that includes fetching and saving quotes, category-wise organization, light and dark themes, detailed quote screens, and even creating quote wallpapers, Quotes offers an immersive environment where users can find daily inspiration and motivation.

## *Key Features:
>#### *SQLite Database:
>The app utilizes SQLite for efficient storage and management of quotes. Users can browse quotes organized by categories, which are saved in a local database for quick and seamless access.

>#### *Local JSON Bank:
>The application includes a built-in collection of quotes stored in a local JSON file. This ensures that the app has offline functionality, enabling users to access quotes without an internet connection.

>#### *API Calling:
>Quotes integrates with external APIs to fetch additional quotes, expanding the collection beyond the local JSON file, providing users with a continually growing library of quotes.

>## *Animations:
>Smooth and interactive animations enhance the user experience, bringing dynamic visual feedback to various elements like transitions between screens, button presses, and loading states.
